## ChatGPT Powered Assistant Guide

What is a prompt? 
A prompt for a Large Language Model (LLM) is a text input that initiates a conversation or triggers a response from the model. However, it can be in other forms such as an image or audio.

 

What is prompt engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively guide a language model's responses.

I am using the free version of Chat GPT, since I am still getting familiar with the AI assistants.

## Tips

Just like Meta AI there is no specific formatting to best provide context.

- Write clear instructions
These models can’t read your mind. If outputs are too long, ask for brief replies. If outputs are too simple, ask for expert-level writing. If you dislike the format, demonstrate the format you’d like to see. The less the model has to guess at what you want, the more likely you’ll get it.

-Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks
Just as it is good practice in software engineering to decompose a complex system into a set of modular components, the same is true of tasks submitted to a language model. Complex tasks tend to have higher error rates than simpler tasks.
