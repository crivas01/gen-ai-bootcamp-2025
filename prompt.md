## Examples

Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
    <user:input>
    Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not provide the japanese characters, the cells just blank
    - BAD: the beginning sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing vocabulary table.
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's start with the vocabulary. Here's a table with some words that might be helpful:

    | Japanese | Romaji | English |
    |          | kuma	| bear | 
    |          | tobira	| door |
    |          | gomi	| garbage |
    |          | nokosu	| leave behind | 
    |          | iru 	| exist/be (animate) |

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses here:
    Bears are at the door.
    Did you leave the garbage out?
    We'll need to connect these two clauses somehow. Think about how you would express existence (e.g., "there is/are") and how you would ask a question in Japanese.
    What's your next step?

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>10</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediatly
    - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations
    </score_reasons>

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
